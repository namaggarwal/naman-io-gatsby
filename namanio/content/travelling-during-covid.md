After an amazing 6.5 years, I left Singapore for good last week. It should just have been an emotional trip back home, but thanks to 2020, it was more worrying. COVID has made travelling extremely difficult and I had the first-hand experience of it. Here is an account of how it was like -

## Buying a ticket
Rising cases in India and Singapore meant there were no flights back home. My visa to Singapore was expiring and I already got it renewed two times before. Then, I got an email from the Indian embassy, "Please visit the airline's office at 2 pm tomorrow to get a seat on repatriation flight". Knowing how the Indian system work, I reached around 12.30 pm to get a ticket. There were few people in the office and I got a ticket within minutes. They had a list of names and were only giving tickets to the people on the list.  I think had I reached the office on time (2 pm) I might not have got the ticket since the flight was full.

## Check-in
After saying goodbyes I reached the airport with my friends 4 hours before the flight (as mentioned in my ticket). Instead of allowing me to queue at the check-in counter, I was handed over some declaration forms and a slip that mentioned my check-in time. My check-in time was still an hour away, so I made a few calls and clicked some pictures to pass the time. Then came my turn and it took less than 5 minutes to check-in and I was sent to another queue. Here Indian embassy officials took the declaration form and allowed us to move to immigration.

## Immigration
Immigration at Singapore was pretty standard, I went to the Immigration official handed over my passport. She looked at it, stamped it and off I go.

## Waiting Area
Singapore airport is the best airport in the world. The one thing I missed during this trip was the water. All the water outlets were closed to prevent the spread of COVID, so I had to buy the overpriced bottle from the lone shop that was opened.

## Security
Like any other trip, people formed a long queue at security.  Security followed the standard procedure, take out your laptops, jackets etc. It went pretty smooth.

## Holding Area
This is where you start to get the feeling that it's not going to be a normal flight. You can see a lot of people wearing gloves, suits etc (mask was compulsory). Some of us were handed out additional suits and everyone was given a mask, face shield and some tissues. Then came the announcement and we started boarding.

## Flight
Flight was full. You were required to wear your masks and face shield at all times. Food was packed and kept on every seat, though few ate it. It was a night flight, but sleeping with a mask and face shield was next to impossible. Flight entertainment was turned off as well.

## Arrival
All the norms of social distancing were gone once the flight landed at Delhi airport. As usual people formed queues to get out of the plane standing close to each other. As soon as we got out we were made to sit in a holding area for briefing and filling health declarations.

## Health Check and Briefing
There were 3 counters for the health check (temperature screening) and everyone was asked to queue. Officials at the airport tried their best to maintain social distancing. After the temperature screening, everyone was asked to go to a special holding area according to their state. I went to Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan holding area.

## Grouping, Immigration and Baggage
The officials took our passport and put a sticker with a number, dividing us into groups of 30 each. We were told that all other formalities will happen group wise. While maintaining social distancing we were taken to immigration and then baggage collection. I was impressed with the protocols and arrangements. Our passports were now taken away in a bag and were again asked to go to individual state counters.

## Haryana State Counter
At the counter, I was given a form to fill a district-specific form (Gurugram in my case). I was handed over my passport as well. There was one CRPF (central police) officer at the exit, who only allowed people out after confirmation from state officials. I filled the form and waited for my turn. A lot of people just kept breaking the queue despite several pleas from the officials. I went in and was asked to select a hotel for 7 days or a government-sponsored quarantine facility. I asked if I can do home quarantine which was politely declined. I chose my hotel and was then asked to present a proof of my Gurugram residency. I contacted my brother to get the residency proof and I was allowed to leave.

## Exit
At the exit, CRPF official still didn't allow me to leave asking me to bring state official personally. So I did and was finally allowed to exit. Just outside several cab drivers offered me to drive to the hotel which is like less than 8 km for Rs. 2000 - Rs. 4000, normal price is Rs. 300. I took a pre-paid cab which cost me 600 Rs and the person didn't give me any receipt. After 4 hours at the airport, I was in no mood for an argument.

## Hotel
Cab driver sanitized his car and drove me to the hotel. I was given a room for 7 days at Govt. subsidized rate of Rs. 3000 including food which is pretty decent for 4-star hotel. I was asked not to come out of the room for the next 7 days and a COVID test was arranged for me on 6th day after which I was allowed to leave.
